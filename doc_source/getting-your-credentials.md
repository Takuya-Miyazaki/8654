# Getting your credentials<a name="getting-your-credentials"></a>

When you create an AWS account, your account is provided with root credential, or an access key, which consists of the following:
+ An access key ID
+ A secret access key

For more information about your access keys, see [Understanding and getting your security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

## Grant programmatic access<a name="grant-programmatic-access"></a>

Users need programmatic access if they want to interact with AWS outside of the AWS Management Console\. The way to grant programmatic access depends on the type of user that's accessing AWS:
+ If you manage identities in IAM Identity Center, the AWS APIs require a profile, and the AWS Command Line Interface requires a profile or an environment variable\.
+ If you have IAM users, the AWS APIs and the AWS Command Line Interface require access keys\. Whenever possible, create temporary credentials that consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token that indicates when the credentials expire\.

To grant users programmatic access, choose one of the following options\.


****  

| Which user needs programmatic access? | To | By | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Workforce identity \(Users managed in IAM Identity Center\)  | Use short\-term credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS APIs \(directly or by using the AWS SDKs\)\. |  Following the instructions for the interface that you want to use: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html)  | 
| IAM | Use short\-term credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS APIs \(directly or by using the AWS SDKs\)\. | Following the instructions in [Using temporary credentials with AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html) in the IAM User Guide\. | 
| IAM | Use long\-term credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS APIs \(directly or by using the AWS SDKs\)\.\(Not recommended\) | Following the instructions in [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in the IAM User Guide\. |
