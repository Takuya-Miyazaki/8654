This topic is part of a tutorial that demonstrates how to invoke a Lambda function through Amazon API Gateway using the AWS SDK for JavaScript\. To start at the beginning of the tutorial, see [Invoking Lambda with API Gateway](api-gateway-invoking-lambda-example.md)\.

To set up and run this example, you must first complete these tasks:
+ Set up the project environment to run these Node TypeScript examples, and install the required AWS SDK for JavaScript and third\-party modules\. Follow the instructions on[ GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javascriptv3/example_code/cross-services/lambda-api-gateway/README.md)\.
+ Create a shared configurations file with your user credentials\. For more information about providing a credentials JSON file, see [Loading credentials in Node\.js from the shared credentials file](loading-node-credentials-shared.md)\.
