AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload\-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes\. 

The JavaScript API for AWS Lambda is exposed through the [LambdaService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-lambda/) client class\.

Here are a list of examples that demonstrate how to create and use Lambda functions with the AWS SDK for JavaScript v3:
