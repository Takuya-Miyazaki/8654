**SDK for JavaScript \(v3\)**  
 Shows how to create an AWS serverless workflow by using AWS Step Functions and the AWS SDK for JavaScript\. Each workflow step is implemented using an AWS Lambda function\.   
Lambda is a compute service that enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers\. Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business\-critical applications\.   
 For complete source code and instructions on how to set up and run, see the full example on [GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javascriptv3/example_code/cross-services/lambda-step-functions)\.
