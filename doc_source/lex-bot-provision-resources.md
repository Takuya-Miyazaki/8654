# Create the AWS resources<a name="lex-bot-provision-resources"></a>

This topic is part of a tutorial that create an Amazon Lex chatbot within a web application to engage your web site visitor\. To start at the beginning of the tutorial, see [Building an Amazon Lex chatbot](lex-bot-example.md)\.

This tutorial requires the following resources\.
+ An unauthenticated IAM role with attached permissions to:
  + Amazon Comprehend
  + Amazon Translate
  + Amazon Lex

You can create this resources manually, but we recommend provisioning these resources using AWS CloudFormation as described in this tutorial\.

## Create the AWS resources using AWS CloudFormation<a name="lex-bot-example-resources-cli"></a>

AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly\. For more information about AWS CloudFormation, see the [AWS CloudFormation developer guide\.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)\.

To create the AWS CloudFormation stack using the AWS CLI:

1. Install and configure the AWS CLI following the instructions in the [AWS CLI User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)\.

1. Create a file named `setup.yaml` in the root directory of your project folder, and copy the content [ here on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/javascriptv3/example_code/cross-services/lex-bot/setup.yaml) into it\.
**Note**  
The AWS CloudFormation template was generated using the AWS CDK available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/resources/cdk/lex_bot_example_iam_unauth_role)\. For more information about the AWS CDK, see the [AWS Cloud Development Kit \(AWS CDK\) Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/)\.

1. Run the following command from the command line, replacing *STACK\_NAME* with a unique name for the stack\.
**Important**  
The stack name must be unique within an AWS Region and AWS account\. You can specify up to 128 characters, and numbers and hyphens are allowed\.

   ```
   aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME --template-body file://setup.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   ```

   For more information on the `create-stack` command parameters, see the [AWS CLI Command Reference guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html), and the [AWS CloudFormation User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-creating-stack.html)\.

   To view the resources created, open the Amazon Lex console, choose the stack, and select the **Resources** tab\.
