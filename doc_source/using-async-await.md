# Using async/await<a name="using-async-await"></a>

Rather than using promises, you should consider using async/await\. Async functions are simpler and take less boilerplate than using promises\. Await can only be used in an async function to asynchronously wait for a value\.

The following example uses async/await to list all of your Amazon DynamoDB tables in `us-west-2`\.

**Note**  
For this example to run:  
Install the AWS SDK for JavaScript DynamoDB client by entering `npm install @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` in the command line of your project\.
Ensure you have configured your AWS credentials correctly\. For more information, see [Loading credentials in Node\.js from the shared credentials file](loading-node-credentials-shared.md)\. 

```
import { DynamoDBClient, 
ListTablesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
(async function () {
    const dbClient = new DynamoDBClient({ region: "us-west-2" });
    const command = new ListTablesCommand({});

    try {
        const results = await dbClient.send(command);
        console.log(results.TableNames.join('\n'));
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err)
    }
})();
```

**Note**  
 Not all browsers support async/await\. See [Async functions](https://caniuse.com/#feat=async-functions) for a list of browsers with async/await support\.
