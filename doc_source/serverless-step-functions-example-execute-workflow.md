# Execute your workflow by using the Step Functions console<a name="serverless-step-functions-example-execute-workflow"></a>

This topic is part of a tutorial that demonstrates to to invoke Lambda functions using AWS Step Functions\. To start at the beginning of the tutorial, see [Creating AWS serverless workflows using AWS SDK for JavaScript](serverless-step-functions-example.md)\.

You can invoke the workflow on the Step Functions console\. An execution receives JSON input\. For this example, you can pass the following JSON data to the workflow\.

```
{
"inputCaseID": "001"
}
```

To execute your workflow:

1. On the Step Functions console, choose **Start execution**\.

1. In the **Input** section, pass the JSON data\. View the workflow\. As each step is completed, it turns green\.

1. If the step turns red, an error occurred\. You can click the step and view the logs that are accessible from the right side\.

Congratulations, you have created an AWS serverless workflow by using the AWS SDK for Java\. As stated at the beginning of this tutorial, be sure to terminate all of the resources you create while going through this tutorial to ensure that youâ€™re not charged\. You can do this by deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack you created in the [Create the AWS resources ](serverless-step-functions-example-create-resources.md) topic of this tutorial,as follows:

1. Open the [AWS CloudFormation in the AWS management console]( https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)\.

1. Open the **Stacks** page, and select the stack\.

1. Choose **Delete**\.
