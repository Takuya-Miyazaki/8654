# Delete the AWS resources<a name="transcribe-app-destroy"></a>

This topic is part of a tutorial about building an app that transcribes and displays voice messages for authenticated users\. To start at the beginning of the tutorial, see [Build a transcription app with authenticated users](transcribe-app.md)\. 

When you finish the tutorial, you should delete the resources so you do not incur any unnecessary charges\. Because you added content to both Amazon S3 buckets, you must delete them manually\. Then you can delete the remaining resources using either the [AWS Web Services Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html) or the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-creating-stack.html)\. Instructions on how to modify the stack, or to delete the stack and its associated resources when you have finished the tutorial, see [here on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/resources/cdk#running-a-cdk-app)\.
