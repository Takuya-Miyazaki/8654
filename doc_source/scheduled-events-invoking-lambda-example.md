# Creating scheduled events to execute AWS Lambda functions<a name="scheduled-events-invoking-lambda-example"></a>

You can create a scheduled event that invokes an AWS Lambda function by using an Amazon CloudWatch Event\. You can configure a CloudWatch Event to use a cron expression to schedule when a Lambda function is invoked\. For example, you can schedule a CloudWatch Event to invoke an Lambda function every weekday\.

AWS Lambda is a compute service that enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers\. You can create Lambda functions in various programming languages\. For more information about AWS Lambda, see [What is AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)\.

In this tutorial, you create a Lambda function by using the Lambda JavaScript runtime API\. This example invokes different AWS services to perform a specific use case\. For example, assume that an organization sends a mobile text message to its employees that congratulates them at the one year anniversary date, as shown in this illustration\.

![\[DynamoDB table\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/)![\[DynamoDB table\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/)![\[DynamoDB table\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/)

The tutorial should take about 20 minutes to complete\.

This tutorial shows you how to use JavaScript logic to create a solution that performs this use case\. For example, you'll learn how to read a database to determine which employees have reached the one year anniversary date, how to process the data, and send out a text message all by using a Lambda function\. Then you’ll learn how to use a cron expression to invoke the Lambda function every weekday\.

This AWS tutorial uses an Amazon DynamoDB table named Employee that contains these fields\.
+ **id** \- the primary key for the table\.
+ **firstName** \- employee’s first name\.
+ **phone** \- employee’s phone number\.
+ **startDate** \- employee’s start date\.
