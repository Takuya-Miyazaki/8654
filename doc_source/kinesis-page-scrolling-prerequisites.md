To set up and run this example, you must first complete these tasks:
+ Set up the project environment to run these Node TypeScript examples, and install the required AWS SDK for JavaScript and third\-party modules, including *webpack*\. Follow the instructions on[ GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/javascriptv3/example_code/kinesis/README.md)\.
+ Create a shared configurations file with your user credentials\. For more information about providing a credentials JSON file, see [Loading credentials in Node\.js from the shared credentials file](loading-node-credentials-shared.md)\.

**Important**  
These examples demonstrate how to import/export client service objects and command using ECMAScript6 \(ES6\)\.  
This requires Node\.js version 13\.x or higher\. To download and install the latest version of Node\.js, see [Node\.js downloads\.](https://nodejs.org/en/download)\.
If you prefer to use CommonJS syntax, see [JavaScript ES6/CommonJS syntax](sdk-example-javascript-syntax.md)\.
