There are several ways to supply your credentials to the SDK from browser scripts\. Some of these are more secure and others afford greater convenience while developing a script\.

 Here are the ways you can supply your credentials, in order of recommendation:

1. Using Amazon Cognito Identity to authenticate users and supply credentials

1. Using web federated identity

1. Hard coding in the script

**Warning**  
We do not recommend hard coding your AWS credentials in your scripts\. Hard coding credentials poses a risk of exposing your access key ID and secret access key\.
